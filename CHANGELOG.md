## 1.0 – 2019-09-29

This is a major release. Upgrading will only take a few minutes and mostly just involves restructuring the config file, but this release is a major departure from previous versions of the package in a few ways, and therefore it **is not backwards compatible.**

#### Breaking changes

##### Completely restructure configuration file to reduce boilerplate and nesting

The top-level `panels` array containing panels, which in turn contained settings, has been replaced with a single `settings` array. The structure of each setting has remained mostly the same, and the panel that a setting belongs to is now specified directly in that setting. Panels are computed based on the unique values of all settings' `panel` keys.

Within individual settings:

- the `name` key has been renamed to `label`
- `description` has been renamed to `help` and now accepts any valid HTML
- `link` has been removed because `help` accepts HTML
- all keys are now optional except `key`

The top-level `navigation` key in the config file has been renamed to `sidebar-label`.

##### Rename config file from `settings.php` to `nova-settings-tool.php`

The package's config file has been renamed to avoid possible conflicts. Fixes [#8](https://github.com/bakerkretzmar/nova-settings-tool/issues/8).

##### Change package namespace from `SettingsTool` to `NovaSettingsTool`

In your `NovaServiceProvider.php`, and anywhere else you're importing the tool, update your imports:

```diff
- use Bakerkretzmar\SettingsTool\SettingsTool;
+ use Bakerkretzmar\NovaSettingsTool\SettingsTool;
```

##### Remove support for assigning default values to settings

This package doesn't affect the behaviour of your app, it just provide's a nice interface for managing settings in Nova—so setting something like `'default' => 'true'` on a toggle, as was previously possible, _wouldn't actually set a default value for the setting_, it would just change the way the setting was initially _displayed_, which could be misleading. Reverts [a4ad702](https://github.com/bakerkretzmar/nova-settings-tool/commit/a4ad702f29b9229e4d55f5150cb2deba47079932) and closes [#17](https://github.com/bakerkretzmar/nova-settings-tool/issues/17).
